Raspi Robotic Arm driver board is basically a single sided PCB designed to be used with the common unbranded robotic arms. Mainly this one http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/like/221457423058?limghlpsr=true&hlpv=2&ops=true&viphx=1&hlpht=true&lpid=108&device=c&adtype=pla&crdt=0&ff3=1&ff11=ICEP3.0.0&ff12=67&ff13=80&ff14=108   
   
There are 2 types of these arms, the USB one and the remote one. This board is designed for the remote one for use with a microcontroller, for example Arduino or Raspberry Pi.   
It uses 3 L293Ds and takes a single power supply to power all the motors. We normally use a small bench power supply for this but batteries will also work.   
The motors are controlled from the 2 sets of 6 headers and there is also an LED to show when power is being provided to the board.
